# Testing is Waste?

Computers computed, functions and procedures represented computation unit.

Test became someone else's problem or, more dangerously, were run by same people who wrote the code.

Cure is worst than disease. Unit tests are **unlikely** to test more than trillion of the functionality of any given method in a reasonable testing cycle.

The believe that tests are smarter than code, telegraphs latent or bad process.

Most cost effective places to remove bugs are during transition from analysis to design, in design itself and in disciplines of coding. **It is much easier to avoid putting bug in than to take them out.**

The purpose of tests is to create information about your program.

Low risk tests have low payoff. If it always shows positive answers - what is the purpose of this test.&#x20;

While developers run the tests, they are _doing_ and not _thinking_
