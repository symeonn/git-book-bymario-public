# SPRING

## Basics

spring framework provides structure and patterns to make developing process easier

#### Context

Dependency Injection - Spring creates objects and put them in context, then Spring inject these objects as dependencies when needed - decouples my class's construction from the construction of their dependencies

Inverse of Control - framework manages all the dependencies and puts your application in this \(instead i have to include libraries into my app\) \(Hollywood principle\)
