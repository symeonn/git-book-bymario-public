# Paradigms

## Functional Programming

* use function without side-effects
* only return the result and combine with another and set as parameter of another function
* Avoid changing state or mutation.
* do not use assignment statements

[Functional programming in java.](../java/#functional-interface)

## Procedural Programming

use functions or blocks of code in desired order to build functionality, eg:

```
void getEntity() {
    verifyUser();
    validateAccess();
    accuireEntities();
    processEntity();
    notifyUser();
}
```

(is above an antipattern??)

## Structured Programming



## Object-Oriented Programming

functionalities and data are encapsulated into objects. Selection of objects happens in the runtime



## Declarative Programming
