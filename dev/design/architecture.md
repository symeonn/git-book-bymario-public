# Architecture

## Good architecture is about deferring decisions about UI, DB, service layer, frameworks, web servers etc.&#x20;

Architecture is about whole high level concepts and low level implementation details

programmers are architectures

Architecture is not about tools and building materials, it is about **usage, how the system is being used,  screams use cases, not delivery mechanism or tools used to build that system**

Arch of program screams the intention of that program like architecture of church screams church intention

Use cases not coupled to delivery mechanisms (UI, DB)
