### TDD

test is written to check the implementation of functionality

 We don’t care much about the output. The only thing needed is to carry out the test in a particular way.

### BDD

testing the actual behavior of the system from the end users perspective

We don’t mind how you come up with the output, only that the output has to be correct under the GIVEN condition.
