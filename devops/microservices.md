# microservices

### Goals

* stability
* feature velocity - team move rapidly and **independently**
* resilient \(sprężysty\) - components are isolated

No one starts with microservices \(there is no need\), but after some point there is need to move to microservices

It is good to start with monolith, as long as you can get away with disadvantages.
